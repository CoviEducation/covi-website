        <div class="team-tabloid-origin-content">
          <p>
            The People’s Science is what happens when two coasts, two projects, and a dozen perspectives come together to work towards a single vision -  a symbiotic relationship between science and society.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2012, our co-founder, Stephanie Sasse, was working on ways to apply research to the real world. Of course, research was already being applied to the real world in countless cringe-worthy, albeit well-intended, ways. Society reached a critical mass of science-inspired common nonsense. Before we figured out what we could do with research, someone needed to clean up the mess. Stephanie began working with her peers to build the Brain Education Project, a program designed to give everyone an insider’s look at the science that surrounds them and the biases that often stand between evidence and progress.
          </p>

          <p>
            Around the same time, Dr. Jamil Zaki was coming to a similar conclusion - scientists and non-scientists are facing a growing cultural gap that is bad for all of us. To address this problem, he built out a forum for researchers to write lay summaries of their work, and named it “The People’s Science”. The forum focused on three things: minimal jargon to maximize access, plenty of resources for scientists to learn the craft of communication, and plenty of space for direct dialogue between readers and the research team.
          </p>

          <p>
            As both initiatives grew, Jamil and Stephanie caught wind of the others’ project. One epic phone call later, they realized that this problem was big enough for the both of them. They joined forces and The People’s Science was born. With the help of co-founder and education extraordinaire, Maya Bialik, The People’s Science was incorporated as a 501(c)3 non-profit in 2015.
          </p>

          <p>
            From there, we built out a team of experts from across the fields of science communication, research, design, and education to identify, synthesize, and strategically attack some of the biggest challenges in 21st century scientific literacy and engagement. We aren’t content creators - we believe there’s plenty of excellent content to go around. Instead, we’re building the infrastructure, the culture, the tools, and the engine to support the incredible work of our colleagues and satiate the curiosities of the public.
          </p>

          <p>
            Two years after its inception, The People’s Science is host to several complementary projects and quickly becoming a go-to for many researchers’ “Broader Impact”. We have a growing network of collaborators and partners working tirelessly to make the difference we all want to see in the world. We’re arming researchers with the skills and opportunities to share their science, and arming citizens with the resources and dispositions to know what to do with it.
          </p>

          <p>
            It’s no simple task and there’s a long way to go. But together, we’ve got this.
