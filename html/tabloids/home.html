            The barriers we’re addressing are complex, interdependent, and deeply ingrained in our cultural fabric. We’re not the first to tackle them, and we won’t be the last. As such, it’s important to us to choose the role we hope to fill wisely. So we decided to start with the past. We  synthesized the hard-earned wisdom of those who’ve come before us, in hopes that we can share what we learn with everyone who comes after.

              Access is not an outcome; it’s an ideology. It’s something you keep chasing as you keep learning where the walls still exist. This initiative was born out of frustration for the educational system's lack of access, especially in lifelong learning, skill-building, and science education.
            </p>

            <p>
              To make science accessible, we believe in a “hierarchy of access needs”. By holistically addressing each of these need in all of our initiatives, we believe that we can break down the barriers between research and public communities.
            </p>

            <p class="subparagraph">
              <b>Financial Access.</b> With all of the costs of daily life, few are going to pay for access to expensive journals or subscriptions to scientific magazines. We have to make sure the knowledge is freely available to everyone who stands to benefit from it. This means open source, free workshops, and well-done resources synthesizing otherwise unavailable ideas. Science exists to serve the society that supports it - and that means the science isn’t done until it’s shared.
            </p>

            <p class="subparagraph">
              <b>Technical Access.</b> Even if you could get your hands on a peer-reviewed journal, many people wouldn’t be able to break down the esoteric jargon the studies are filled with. And even if you could read the jargon, you may still not know how to interpret the concepts unless you’re a “local” to the field. This is true for many members of the public and the scientific community alike. We have to break down technical barriers, like language and nature of science principles, to make sure that the content that is available is truly accessible. That means using multiple representations of content whenever possible, and partnering with experts in learning differences, to make sure that everyone is in the loop.
            </p>

            <p class="subparagraph">
              <b>Psychological Access.</b> Let’s say a resource is free and you can technically understand it... our job may still not be done. You have to want to engage with it in the first place. Identity is a complex thing that is rooted in cultural expectations, internalization of stereotypes, and past experiences. For many, society has sent the message that science isn’t “for” them. Women, people of color, and individuals with disabilities remain incredibly underrepresented in research. It’s our goal to close the accessibility gap by rebranding science, taking it out of its ivory tower, and entangling it with the real world curiosities of everyday life, where everyone can reach it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some people will want to learn every detail about a specific study; others will just want the gist of an important discovery. Regardless of the depth you choose to dig in, access is about giving everyone somewhere to start.

              Systems science shows us that small biases in individual agents can result in tremendous biases in a population. These biases drive many of society’s most visible issues and stifle the consideration of new ideas. By acknowledging bias and training ourselves to understand the nature and variability of information, we have the power to take control of our interactions, our decisions, and our progress.
            </p>

            <p>
              Consuming and sharing information is like playing a game of telephone; it’s hard to know what to trust. We believe that bias has to be destigmatized and embraced as a inherent feature of information, self, and society. Though these components are highly interdependent, considering each is useful for developing powerful strategies and habits of mind. By doing so, we can navigate the information landscape with the right balance of excitement and skepticism.
            </p>

            <p class="subparagraph">
              <b>Information Bias.</b> In an ideal world, information would be pure and binary; it would be true or false. Unfortunately, information in the real world is much more complex. Even evidence from scientific studies designed to minimize bias is crafted and disorted by the methods used to uncover it, the statistics used to interpret it, and how it compares to other information of its day. It’s essential to understand these influences, so you can be more critical in your evaluations.

              <b>Self Bias.</b> Reality, as many have said, is idiosyncratically constructed by each individual. No two realities are the same. We shape our understanding of the world constantly and without realizing it. Research has shown that memories change to fit our beliefs, what we see is affected by what we expect, and what we accept is based on what we already think. We’ll never overcome our biases compeletely, as they have served important roles in our evolutionary history, but we can be aware of them... which gives us the power to override our impulses and double check our assumptions.
            </p>

            <p class="subparagraph">
              <b>Societal Bias.</b> If one person is biased, imagine what that makes a group. Society is a complicated, nested system of individuals, each with their own perspectives, that collectively results in a whole new set of emergent biases. Every culture and community has its own values, attitudes, and history that can shape the way its members interact with information. The same claim can be embraced by one group and vehemently rejected by another. By understanding these factors, we can begin to disentangle information from the group that shaped its presentation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Understanding how these biases craft the information we interact with is key to changing the way we assess evidence and make decisions. The goal isn’t to paralyze, but to scrutinize - information itself, the society that shapes it, and most importantly, ourselves.

            Access and bias are two compelentary concepts that span all layers of our world. In a sense, access is the yin to bias’ yang. Access is the go, while bias is the brakes. We believe that by developing access points at the identify, scientific, and cultural levels, we can empower and excite individuals to effectively interact with and apply evidence to their personal, professional, and political lives. On the other hand, by increasing their ability to recognize bias across information, self, and society, they can learn when to step back and apply strategies to ensure their engagement is both critical and responsible.
          </p>

          <p>
            To do this well, we believe it is crucial that we refine our own understanding of the core components of these systems, so that we can design solutions that fit.

            Identity or sense of self is the emergent output of a convulted mix of dispositional, constructed, and associative characteristics. We are born with both certain dispositions and associations. These can include traits like anxiety or group memberships based on our family, social class, gender, or ethnicity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over time, these innate characteristics begin to interact with characteristics that we, or our environment, constructs. This is things like the groups we choose to join, the beliefs that we adopt, and the habits or attitudes we take on towards certain things.
            </p>
            <p>
              Identity can have a dramatic impact on what evidence we choose to believe, and what access points we take advantage of. We call this interaction between research, the real world, and an individual their “socio-scientific identity”.  By understanding the complexity of these identities and the unique needs, biases, and attitudes that underly them, we hope to introduce powerful tools for incorporating valuable attitudes, values, and beliefs into them.

              Information architecture is the ways in which we organize our knowledge. This includes journals and their access models, press releases, and the language used in communications.

              Professional expectations are the ways that scientists are required to act in order to be successful, such as the departments’ views towards outreach or the importance placed on high impact results. This is the culture of our scientific community.

              Culture and society is one of the most powerful influences on what we do, who we become, and what we believe. The messages crafted by famous figures, entertainment, social networks, news, and the media are our primary way of gaining new knowledge as adults. These messages interface with our historical narratives, our ideologies, our built environment, and our cultural conventions to become the things we claim to “know”. Unfortunately, the quality is incredible inconsistent.
            </p>
            <p>
              By considering the way that ideas propogate and distort across these societal filters, we can begin to design ways to improve the system. By understanding the importance of persuasive psycholigical mechanisms at play, like the bandwagon effect or the truth effect, we can reconsider our approach to align with the way people actually absorb and learn in their daily lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              Educational efforts often remain independent of pop culture and societal patterns. We believe that by studying the successes and fundamentals of these systems, we can leverage their insights to promote positive change.

              <h5 class="uppercase">Openness</h5>
              Everyone may define openness differently, but there are certain things about its essence that remain constant. Openness demands that something be inherently unlocked. It means there are no barriers to entry. Anyone can simply walk in and make themselves at home simply by crossing the threshold. Through open source code, shared resources, and intentional design, we believe in developing projects that are truly open and available to all.
            </p>

            <p>
              <h5 class="uppercase">Iteration</h5>
              We believe that good solutions are always a work in progress. Designs have to be adaptable to keep up with the needs of the people they’re crafted to serve. We also believe in listening, deconstructing, and rebuilding until we get it right. That means synthesizing the latest research to build a strategy, designing an engaging interface and curriculum, and asking everyone who will answer what they think of it. Good educational design isn’t static, it’s responsive.
            </p>

            <p>
              <h5 class="uppercase">Aesthetics</h5>
              Marketing, advertising, and other for-profit efforts capitalize on the power of pretty. We believe that people respond to and prefer to engage with materials and platforms that are easy on the eyes. With so much competing for people’s attention, it’s high time educational resources got the edge.

            <p>
              <h5 class="uppercase">Structure</h5>
              Structure gives information value. It’s by structuring your ideas that that they take on a communicable and tangible form that others can use. This belief is the root of our project development. We begin every initiative by building out a summative framework to organize our ideas, the problem space, and the evidence that may inform our next steps.

            <h5 class="uppercase">Theory</h5>
            Research is at the core of everything we do. We aren’t the first to think through these issues, and we’re doing what we can to avoid reinventing any wheels. That means that we have to synthesize research from across relevant fields, like Public Understanding of Science, Learning Sciences, Science Communication, and Science, Technology, and Society, to help us answer key questions: What do the patterns tell us about the appeal of binaries or updating attitudes and behaviors? What implementation challenges and solutions does the research point to? And how do we translate empirical syntheses into practical models? We also study efforts that have come before us, so that their successes and failures inform our strategies and next steps.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h5 class="uppercase">Evaluation</h5>
            All of the rationale in the world means nothing if it doesn’t work. We have to put our strategies in the hands and environments of people and constantly ask ourselves two questions: Is it engaging? And is it working? If the answer is no, then we re-evaluate our approach. We work with researchers across fields to put our programs through rigorous quantitative and qualitative evaluations. When we see there’s more work to be done, we try to remain innovative and look for strategies in other sectors that lend themselves to our goals. We look for dots that have never been connected before and use technology as a mechanism for new solutions
          </p>
          <p>
            <h5 class="uppercase">Contribution</h5>
            We also believe in giving back to the communities that we’ve borrowed from. That means designing solid research studies and writing our reports to share our findings through peer-reviewed journals.
