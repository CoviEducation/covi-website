            The barriers we’re addressing are complex, interdependent, and deeply ingrained in our cultural fabric. We’re not the first to tackle them, and we won’t be the last. As such, it’s important to us to choose the role we hope to fill wisely. So we decided to start with the past. We  synthesized the hard-earned wisdom of those who’ve come before us, in hopes that we can share what we learn with everyone who comes after.

            The result is a skill-buiding, access-oriented framework that is designed to plug into a wide range of projects. We’ve focused on the practical, the strategy, and the design, so that others can focus on interfacing with the communities that they know best.

            Rather than reinvent the wheel, we’re taking full advantage of the resources that already exist - and  building the engine to power a movement.

        <h1>The Logistics</h1>
        <p>
          The People's Science is a 501(c)3 non-profit run by a team of researchers, designers, educators, and volunteers. We serve as an umbrella organization that hosts a number of initiatives that provide centralized, interactive spaces for the public and scientists to meet, converse, access educational resources, and facilitate the interaction between science and society. We work with a wide range of scientific fields and community groups to host a number of projects aimed at strengthening the relationship between scientists and non-scientists. The ultimate goal is to create a space and gateway for scientific and non-scientific communities to interact, develop skills, communicate and co-operate on a freely accessible platform using freely accessible tools.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our goals include:
          <ol>
            <li>Cultivate dialogue between researchers and the public</li>
            <li>Centralize resources to make knowledge more accessible</li>
            <li>Train researchers to effectively communicate their science</li>
            <li>Empower citizens to critically engage with socio-scientitic issues, science communication, and citizen science</li>
            <li>Leverage innovations in educational technology to provide cutting-edge learning tools</li>
            <li>Promote scientific and information literacy skills, as well as the responsible application of evidence</li>
            <li>Empirically assess our strategies to contribute new evidence to relevant fields</li>
            <li>Build community by partnering with those actively working to improve the relatonship between science,              society, and the individual</li>

        <h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
        (Quick Look)
        <p>
          Every organization is built on a number of core values. We believe that these tenets serve as the foundation that supports everything we do. We’ve composed our philosophy through theory, self-reflection and by paying attention to the character of the organizations we respect most. They keep us accountable, they keep us evolving, and most importantly, they keep us inspired.

          <div class="mission-philosophy-item">
            <h4>Access</h4>
            We believe that science shuld be truly accessible to everyone. True access includes financial, technical, and psychological access. Such solutions require examining the current patterns within culture, identities, and science itself, as well as the ways they interact.
          </div>

          <div class="mission-philosophy-item">
            <h4>Bias</h4>
            Bias has a bad rep, which often leads people to try to avoid rather than understand it. We believe that bias is an inherent feature of self, information, and society. Most importantly, we believe that embracing and truly understanding these biases changes everything.
          </div>

          <div class="mission-philosophy-item">
            <h4>Collaboration</h4>
            We are working against an intertial system, and if we want to steer the future of science and society, we’re going to have to work together. We believe in partnerships, dialogue between citizens and researchers, interdisciplinary approaches, and decentralized efforts. We can’t tackle this problem from a hundred different angles and expect results - we need to join forces and face it head on as a unified front that refuses to be ignored.

        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <div class="mission-philosophy-item">
            <h4>Design</h4>
            Design is one part structure, one part aesthetic, and one part iteration. We believe that the combination of the three takes ideas and turns them into usable tools that can be shared, implemented, and refined over time.
          </div>

          <div class="mission-philosophy-item">
            <h4>Evidence</h4>
            We believe in starting at the edge of what is known and using evidence to inform strategy. We also believe in rigorously evaluating our efforts and reporting them to contribute to the landscape of what we know. As such, we believe in a feedback loop: we build based on what we know, we evaluate what we build, and we share what we learn with the community that shares our mission.
