    #ShareYourScience is a movement and website that connects researchers to outreach opportunities and the tools that they need to be effective communicators.

      <h5>
        Science started when curious societies had enough resources to create roles with the sole purpose of learning more about the world.
      </h5>
      There was no tenure. There was no “publish-or-perish”. There was no ten year post-docs. Scientists came into existence not to answer their own questions or to further their own careers, but to systematically seek knowledge that may prove beneficial to the society that supports them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since science got its start, many researchers have been distracted from that the final step in the scientific process; not to publish in a peer-reviewed journal, but to make sure that people can access and engage with their discoveries. But that’s starting to change. More researchers than ever are prioritizing public outreach, and more journals are prioritizing “Broader Impacts”.
    </p>

    <p>
      #ShareYourScience aims to celebrate and extend these efforts.
    </p>

    <p>
      <h5>
        Communication is hard and time is limited.
      </h5>
      Modern science is typically a fast-paced, highly specialized career path. There’s rarely training in how to be an effective communicator, and very little time to dedicate to extracurricular efforts that don’t fit neatly into a researcher’s CV. We have collected training resources, outreach opportuntiies, and  relevant research from across the web and put them all in one place. It’s a one-stop-shop for researchers interested in honing their skills and quickly evaluating the ways to share that make the most sense for them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The #ShareYourScience hashtag also provides a tool for active researchers to share their efforts and support the efforts of others.
