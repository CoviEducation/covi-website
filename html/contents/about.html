      <b>Our mission.</b><br/>
      Scientists and the public vitally depend on each other.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just as the scientific breakthroughs made 30 years ago shape our lives now, the progress being made all around us today will shape our futures. In the same vein, this progress depends on public support of scientific endeavors and responsible consideration of their implications. And yet, most of what the public knows about ongoing science comes to us indirectly, from press offices, journalists, or businesses.
    </p>

    <p>
      It can be challenging for the public and policy makers to distinguish between sensational and informed claims without training, support, and access. Scientists and non-scientists face a growing cultural gap that is bad for all of us.
    </p>

    <p>
      The People's Science is designed to reduce this gap, through a centralized, interactive collection of projects that are accessible, empirically informed, and built on the foundation of collaboration between researchers, designers, educators, and the public.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Our mission is to improve the relationship between science, society, and the individual. Through the strategic design of complementary initiatives, we aim to provide practical tools that are technically, financially, and psychologically accessible to all.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      To do this, we are building a suite of complementary solutions, each addressing a point where the system can be improved. Our current projects include platforms designed to provide lay summaries of research for the public (The Archive), train researchers  on science communication skills and opportunities (#ShareYourScience), expert- and crowd-source science resources (SciHive), train scientific literacy skills (TILT), and empower others to bring our resources to their own communities (BeeHive).
