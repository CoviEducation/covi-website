        Creating a conversation between <b/>researchers and the public

    The Archive is a public forum where researchers post lay summaries of their peer-reviewed work, engage in dialogue with readers, and make their science accessible to all.

    <h5>Filling in the gap.</h5>
    <p>
      When a researcher wants to learn more about a study, they can look up the journal. When someone wants an overview of a general topic, they can look up the media coverage. But what about the in-between? What if you’re a non-expert in a field who wants a straightforward summary of a study written without the jargon?
    </p>

    <p>
      The Archive provides just that: An accessible, brief explanation, written by the researcher, of what they did, what they found, and what they think it means - written with the public in mind. The goal isn’t to replace peer-review or science journalism, but to address the need for a public archive of scientific findings.
    </p>

    <h5>Starting the conversation.</h5>
    <p>
      Think about how it feels when you meet someone famous and they’re kind to you. It usually humanizes them, making them feel more approachable and trustworthy. We believe that opening up a dialogue between researchers and the public can mutually demystify, and start to build positive relationships in both directions while bringing fresh perspectives to the science being done.
    </p>

    <h5>Resources for researchers.</h5>
    <p>
      Most researchers are not trained as communicators. To make it easy to contribute, we provide tools like templates for submissions and  on-site training to get you started. And for those who want more, we built Share Your Science to bring you communication training from across the web. Once you submit, you can track your reach, submit it to grant proposals or reports, and feel good about closing the cycle that science was always meant to take.
