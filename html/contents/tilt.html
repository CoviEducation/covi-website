    TILT is a set of interactive exercises designed to cultivate practical skills for evaluating evidence and understanding the nature of scientific research.

    <h5>Science education needs a facelift.</h5>
    <p>
      Over the past 20 years, research shows that the public’s understanding of many major scientific concepts has remained static or dropped. At the same time, available content has skyrocketed, making science more technically accessible than ever before.
    </p>

    <p>
      The message is clear: Good content just isn’t enough.
    </p>

    <h5>Tilting the right domino.</h5>
    <p>
      TILT, a series of exercises designed to cultivate six core information literacy skills, aims to bridge the gap between content access and content knowledge by providing the skills necessary to evaluate, curate, and apply information to our everyday lives. Technology has revolutionized the way we learn and redefined what “information literacy” looks like. We believe that it has also given us power to understand ourselves, each other, and our world in unprecedented ways. Of course, that power requires refinement, and TILT is designed to help everyone wield it wisely.
    </p>

    <h5>Learning should be lifelong.</h5>
    <p>
      Many of the people voting today finished formal schooling before the Information Age hit critical mass. That means there wasn’t such a pressing need for them to learn how to navigate competing evidence, recognize bias, or evaluate new media credibility. We believe that today’s society requires lifelong learners and lifelong learning opportunities outside of the classroom, so we’re hosting TILT online with no age limits.
