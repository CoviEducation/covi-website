      <h5>
        In the past 20 years, we’ve seen more accessible content available than ever before, yet attitudes towards and understanding of science have not changed.
      </h5>

      It doesn’t have to be that way. Scientific evidence is playing a bigger role in our personal and collective decision-making than ever before. We believe that an informed and empowered citizenry is crucial to overcoming the challenges that we face as people, as nations, and as a global community.
    <p>

    <p>
      We are a 501(c)3 non-profit that is dedicated to providing equitable access points and educational tools to inform individual decision-making and facilitate systemic change.

      <h5>Organization is key.</h5>
      The divide between science and society is a complex problem. Problems with this much inertia require an equal and opposite force to tackle them. There’s power in numbers, so we team up with designers, scientists, educators, and other organizations to craft powerhouse initiatives that leverage interdisciplinary strategies and capitalize on technological innovation. The result is a suite of complementary solutions that seamlessly work together to revolutionize the way we think about research and the public.
    </p>

    <p>
      <h5>It’s working.</h5>
      Our students and beta testers report a need for these initiatives, satisfaction with the designs, and improvements in pertinent skills after engaging with our materials. In the past year, our beta testing has reached over 1000 students and educators whose feedback has guided each project’s development. As a result, we have built partnerships with leading educational organizations nationwide... and we’re just getting started.
