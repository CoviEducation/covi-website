    SciHive gives experts and the public the power to collect and review high quality resources from across the web. The sources are out there, we help you find them.

      <h5>Sharing the responsibility.</h5>
      There’s no FDA for science-based content, which means that there’s no one regulating the information that’s sold or shared under the premise of  “science”. Typically, the onus of responsibility falls on the public to detemine the difference between high and low quality content. Without training, non-experts often rely on the consensus of their political and social affiliations when determining which information to trust. As a result and despite the best intentions, poor quality content can go viral while excellent content stays hidden on Page 10 of Google.

      We can do better.

      <h5>Expert-sourced, crowd-approved.</h5>
      That’s why we created SciHive; the Yelp of science resources. We bring together multi-media resources from across the web into one searchable catalog. We show how experts rate each resource on things like difficulty and accuracy, and how non-experts rate them on things like accessibility and engagement. We’re giving you a curated, one-stop shop for all of your science needs.
    </p>

    <p>
      <h5>Putting good science first.</h5>
      People often complain that there’s not enough good science communication out there. We believe that a lack of content isn’t the problem, it’s finding it and knowing what to trust that gets tricky. We’re creating an interface where everyone can do their part to put the good stuff first.
