        <h2 class="t-white55 t-18dp">Why we care.</h2>
        <p class="t-white">It’s no secret that STEM fields lack diversity. This may be due, in part, to the stereotypes of science and scientists in our society. Pop culture makes matters worse by representing scientists as antisocial, single-minded, and one-dimensional, while showing only a small slice of what scientific research can be. Collectively, this creates a picture in kids’ minds of what it does and does not mean to be a scientist; a picture that currently leaves out the majority of our country’s youth.There is no silver bullet to address this issue, but it’s time to change that picture.</p>
        <h2 class="t-white55 t-18dp">What we do.</h2>
        <p class="t-white">An equitable and enriched future demands diverse STEM leaders. We work with a committee of diversity advocates, outreach specialists, educators, and scientists. We craft multimedia toolkits and strategies to engage and empower students of all backgrounds and interests. Diversity is more than skin deep, so we focus our efforts on breaking the box of what it means to be “smart enough”, rather than simply expanding the parameters.</p>

        <h2 class="t-white55 t-18dp">Why we care.</h2>
        <p class="t-white">Everyday issues are increasingly shaped by evidence. We vote on scientific funding, we make health decisions based on research, our schools are increasingly data-driven, and our prosocial behaviors depend on a critical understanding of our world. And sometimes, we’re just curious. Scientists do this work for the rest of us, but without access to their findings, the onus of responsibility cannot be on the public to draw the responsible conclusions that are increasingly crucial to our wellbeing and an informed society.</p>
        <h2 class="t-white55 t-18dp">What we do.</h2>
        <p class="t-white">Science is, foremost, a service to society, but there’s a communication breakdown. Addressing it means working with scientists, the public, and the spaces in between. We train scientists on effective public communication skills and connect researchers to outreach opportunities. We also build platforms to promote public access to evidence, and develop creative and practical STEM engagement opportunities.</p>

        <h2 class="t-white55 t-18dp">Why we care.</h2>
        <p class="t-white">Staying informed on the evidence-driven issues that are most relevant to us can be challenging - we often lack either the infrastructure or motivation to make it work. Museums, books, and websites do a great job of providing content, but it’s often impractical, disconnected from others, or nested in a stale environment. We live in a society where change happens rapidly, so we need to find a way to truly integrate lifelong learning into our lives.</p>
        <h2 class="t-white55 t-18dp">What we do.</h2>
        <p class="t-white">On the weekends, Study Hall is a lounge where grown ups can stay informed about real world issues while enjoying music, food, and drinks with their friends. During the week, it’s a place for interactive trainings, classroom field trips, and experimental learning labs to test new educational technolology. Study Hall will house a free, rotating art and science exhibition focused on practical education (e.g. human bias; AI; nutrition) that’s open to the public. In addition, it will host special events like trivia nights, debates, and documentary screenings that aim to turn the things you already love into a learning experience.</p>
        <p class="t-white">We’re developing the plans for the first Study Hall to open in San Francisco in late 2017, with the goal of opening additional locations in the near future.</p>

        <h2 class="t-white55 t-18dp">Why we care.</h2>
        <p class="t-white">When the majority of adults were in school, “information literacy” referred to library skills. That’s where we accessed most of our information, so that’s the landscape we learned to navigate. Now, information is everywhere, but our skills have yet to evolve with the technological progress. This results in major deficits in public understanding of practical scientific issues, self sciences, and contemporary critical thinking strategies suited to the unique challenges of the 21st century.</p>
        <h2 class="t-white55 t-18dp">What we do.</h2>
        <p class="t-white">Good content just isn’t enough. We have to provide tools for people to evaluate information repsonsibly. We believe this includes: scientific literacy, digitial literacy, media literacy, and psychological literacy. We develop workshops and other immersive training experiences to coach communities on the nature of different types of information, the biases inherent in evidence as it flows through societal and media systems, and the heuristics we can use to become more responsible citizens of the Information Age.</p>

        <p class="t-white">There is a serious lack of formal education on what we call the “self sciences”: psychology, anthropology, neuroscience, and other human-related fields. For many, no such course options exist until college, leaving us to fend for ourselves as we try to navigate our own minds and those of others. Despite knowing more about human nature than ever before, we fail to adequately teach children or adults the particularities of their own minds or the minds of others. We also fail to teach the impact that our biases - often undetected by us - can have on the information, attitudes, policies, decisions, and interactions that shape our daily lives. </p>
        <h2 class="t-white55 t-18dp">What we do.</h2>
        <p class="t-white">We work to provide immersive, curated experiences to share self education, and promote strategies for normalizing, recognizing and overcoming human bias in every day life. We believe in creating a culture that embraces human error, self awareness, and informed reflection so that we can forge practical solutions to minimize the impact that our biases have on the wellbeing of ourselves and others.</p>

      <h2>Information Literacy Projects</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>TILT</h3>
          <h4>Twenty-first century Information Literacy Tools</h4>
          <h5>OVERVIEW</h5>
          <p>The 21st Century is filled with information, and it’s constantly changing as we learn more about the world. At the same time, science is playing an increasingly large role in our decision making and policies. It’s more important than ever to know the “how” of information, not just the “what”.</p>
          <p>This program provides interactive, customizable exercises for teaching the core skills and dispositions of an informed citizen and engaged member of the public. We focus on key media, digital, psychological, and scientific literacy skills. We’re making it simple to keep up in a complex world.</p>

          <h5>EXPANSION</h5>
          <p>We are excited to offer our workshops, as they can be easily tailored to create personalized training for a wide range of audiences. Though we work hard to keep costs low, sometimes free and digital is the better fit. We’re translating our materials to the web so that our attendees can continue learning beyond the workshop, and everyone else can freely access our lesson plans. </p>

          <h3>The Curiocracy</h3>
          <h4>Empowering Curious Communities</h4>
          <h5>OVERVIEW</h5>
          <p>Changes a group effort. We’re building a toolkit and curriculum that can be made available to any group or university club. These TPS Chapters are like extended family: we provide support, resources, and advice on how to effectively promote responsible integration of research in your hometowns.</p>
          <p>Our goal is to decentralize the effort and make it easy for everyone to make a difference in the communities that they know best.</p>

          <h5>EXPANSION</h5>
          <p>We are slowly expanding our reach by partnering with motivated student and community groups nationwide. By co-creating the resources and model, we can ensure that Curiocracy chapters have tools that are both practical and effective. We aim to open chapters in 10 locations by the end of 2018, at which point we’ll begin planning supplementary conferences and webinars to support the growing TPS community.</p>

          <h3>It's Only Human</h3>
          <h4>Exploring the Biases that Shape Our World</h4>
          <h5>OVERVIEW</h5>
          <p>People don’t like learning about the things that are wrong with them, so we use art, technology, and interactive experiments to make it easier. We create a space where being wrong is the default, being biased is assumed, and learning to navigate the shortcomings of human nature is encouraged.</p>
          <p>This art and science exhibition - and its affiliated resources for the public and classroom - uses the science of how people work to teach people how people work - and it’s working.</p>

          <h5>EXPANSION</h5>
          <p>Even the best new platform will only succeed if it’s integrated into the existing dissemination cycle. We’re working with stakeholders on both sides to ensure the platform is sustainable. We’re partnering with journals and existing outreach communities to ensure broad adoption of lay summaries as a part of the research cycle. We’re also working with professional development communities and classrooms to ensure that the content can be useful across formal and informal learning environments.</p>

          <h3>Jiminy</h3>
          <h4>Collaborative Science Sourcing</h4>
          <h5>OVERVIEW</h5>
          <p>Science communication has a curation problem. The responsibility is put entirely on the public to determine high from low quality content. We can do better.</p>
          <p>Jiminy is the Yelp of scientific content. Starting with psychology and neuroscience, we’re collecting resources from all across the web to be organized and rated by experts and the public alike. Together, we can make sure everyone has the power to put good science first.</p>

          <h5>EXPANSION</h5>
          <p>We are increasingly tailoring our tools and materials to the unique needs of each researcher. We are designing an advanced interface where researchers will be able access trainings online or request in-person workshops, track and identify ongoing opportunities in their own communities, and share resources with like-minded researchers. </p>
          <p>The goal is to incorporate basic training into PhD programs nationwide and to provide a support system to make it as easy as possible for emerging researchers to integrate outreach into their identity and culture as a researcher.</p>

        <li>
          <h3>I Am A Scientist</h3>
          <h4>Bringing STEM Diversity to Classrooms</h4>
          <h5>OVERVIEW</h5>
          <p>Pop culture sends a clear message about who is most suited to be a scientist - and it leaves out the majority of our youth. This may contribute to the lack of diversity in STEM fields, and it’s a problem that has to be addressed at a young age.</p>
          <p>This project breaks down common stereotypes about science and scientists by replacing them with stories of real researchers of all backgrounds, personalities, and interests. Our “Scientist of the Month” club makes it possible for educators to seamlessly incorporate a wider range of models into their classroom.</p>

          <h5>EXPANSION</h5>
          <p>Our goal is to freely distribute the toolkit to 10,000 classrooms by the end of 2018. In that time, we’ll be sharing the stories via multimedia and social campaigns. With the collaborative effort of our team of photographers, videographers, writers, anthropologists, and scientists, I Am A Scientist is designed to be a multidimensional campaign worth sharing.</p>

          <h3>The Field</h3>
          <h4>Starting a conversation between scientists & the public.</h4>
          <h5>OVERVIEW</h5>
          <p>Scientists can keep track of the latest research across fields through scientific journals. The public, on the other hand, is often limited to what is picked up by the popular press or forced to comb through the inaccessible jargon of peer-reviewed papers. </p>
          <p>The Field is an online platform that provides an access point between journalism and peer-review by providing lay summaries of individual papers written by the scientists themselves. Readers can follow their favorites and are encouraged to engage in dialogue around each piece.</p>

          <h5>EXPANSION</h5>
          <p>Even the best new platform will only succeed if it’s integrated into the existing dissemination cycle. We’re working with stakeholders on both sides to ensure the platform is sustainable.

          <h4>Resources for researchers.</h4>
          <h5>OVERVIEW</h5>
          <p>We talk a big game about the role of researchers in science communication - but often, even engaged scientists don’t know where to start. </p>
          <p>We’ve centralized resources from across the web to bring researchers the training and opportunities they need to be successful advocates for their work. We’re building workshops and seminars that synthesize the best practices, so researchers are prepared to play an active role in the increasingly consequential sharing of science... and we’re building the community to sustain it.</p>

          <p>We are increasingly tailoring our tools and materials to the unique needs of each researcher.
