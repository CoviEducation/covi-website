    <h5>Change starts at home, and we want to help.</h5>
    <p>
      At Covi Education, we’re creating a toolkit that we believe will make it easier for anyone to improve engagement with and understanding of evidence in their own communities. We’re sharing our resources with TPS Chapters nationwide, and providing the scaffolds they need to understand the issues and become skilled ambassadors for science in society.
    </p>

    <h5>Decentralizing the effort.</h5>
    <p>
      No one knows the needs or character of a particular community or university as well as its members. TPS headquarters will work to make our resources adaptable, craft step-by-step strategy guides, build cutting-edge curriculum and organize nationwide opportunities for our chapters to connect. Our ambassadors will work to tailor the TPS toolkit to the infrastructure and personality of their hometown in a way that only they can. We believe this collaboration will blend refined materials with grassroot passion to put real change in the hands of every student and citizen.
    </p>

    <h5>Sharing what we’ve learned.</h5>
    <p>
      Over the years, the TPS team has learned some important lessons about often underutilized fields, like Science Communication and Public Understanding of Science. Unfortunately, discourse anchored in these areas is rarely seen before specialized graduate study - and that needs to change. We will complement our Chapters’ practical efforts with educational opportunities. Ambassadors receive access to our interactive eLearning environment where they can learn about major theories and issues, read recent research, and interact with thought leaders from across fields as well as members of other Chapters. By arming them with the insights of insiders, we’re preparing the next generation of game changers.
