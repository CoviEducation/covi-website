      <section class="about__rationale">
        <img src="/images/goal-graph.png" alt="Graph of the intersection of science and society">
        <p class="t-18dp">Scientists and the public vitally depend on each other.</p>

        <p class="t-18dp">Just as the scientific breakthroughs made 30 years ago shape our lives now, the progress being made all around us today will shape our futures. In the same vein, this progress depends on public support of scientific endeavors and responsible interactions with evidence. STEM fields are playing an increasingly important role in shaping our personal, social, and political lives, and yet, there is a lack of infrastructure supporting the public’s engagement and critical evaluation of relevant socioscientific issues.</p>

        <p class="t-18dp">It can be challenging for the public and policy makers to distinguish between sensational and informed claims without training, support, and access. Scientists and non-scientists face a growing cultural gap that is bad for all of us.</p>

        <p class="t-18dp">Additionally, little training is available to facilitate people’s understanding of how their own biases filter the world around them. These are the sorts of broken mechanisms that underlie countless contemporary issues.</p>

        <p class="t-18dp">The People's Science is designed to reduce this gap, through a centralized, interactive collection of projects that are accessible, empirically informed, and built on the foundation of collaboration between researchers, technologistsm designers, educators, and the public. </p>

        <p class="t-18dp"><b>We develop campaigns, curriculum, digital platforms, and immersive experiences that change the way people think about science, society, and themselves. We believe this is the first step towards changing anything else.</b></p>

        <h2>we’re building the engine to power a movement</h2>

        <p class="about__third">We synthesize the hard-earned wisdom of those who’ve come before us to identify the most powerful strategies for creating educational opportunities that actually fit people’s lives.
        <br><br>The result is a suite of resources, toolkits, and campaigns designed to capture people’s curiosity, deliver engaging and practical knowledge, and provide sustainable tools for turning lifelong learning into a lifestyle.</p>

        <img src="/images/engine.png" alt="Picture of an engine" class="about__third">

        <p class="about__third">We make sure that all of our strategies are evaluated and iterated until they’re working consistently and effectively for their intended audience. Once we get it right, we partner with organizations that can tailor our tools to the communities that they serve.
        <br><br>We’re taking full advantage of the resources that already exist, creating the ones that don’t, and putting them to work to change what and how we learn.</p>

    <section class="about_areas u-grid-canvas">
      <h1 class="t-gray3 t-92dp">Our <br> <span class="t-red2">Areas of Focus</span></h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h2>ACCESSIBLE EVIDENCE </h2>
          <p>If research isn’t picked up my mass media or featured in a museum, most members of the public will never see it. Even if they could, it’s often riddled with jargon or blocked by a paywall. With an increasing number of personal, professional, and political issues informed by science, we need to break the barriers of an incomplete dissemination cycle. We need to develop varied, practical opportunities for the public to engage directly with the evidence that matters throughout their lives. In turn, we need to make sure researchers are trained and motivated to do their part.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>SELF & BIAS EDUCATION</h2>
          <p>The lack of formal psychological education is unacceptable, as is the stigma associated with “self-help”. Understanding ourselves is critical to navigating the world responsibly and effectively. We know more about the human mind and brain than ever before, yet misconceptions still all-too-often guide our attitudes and behavior.  To make the most of what we do know, we need a culture that accepts human error, recognizes bias, and promotes self-growth and reflection as a celebrated value.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>DIVERSITY IN STEM</h2>
          <p>The disproportionate representation of minorities and women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is the result of a complicated network of social and systematic factors that need to change. Further, the stereotypes for what science and scientists can be limit who can easily see themselves pursuing these paths. Not only is this unfair to the individual, it’s unfair to the society that STEM fields serve. With the growing influence that these fields have on the way our world works, it is more critical than ever that students of all backgrounds and perspectives have their voices represented. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>21st CENTURY INFORMATION LITERACY SKILLS</h2>
          <p>There is more information available to us than ever before, yet we’re rarely taught strategies for navigating it effectively. We live in a society of echo chambers, sensationalism, confirmation bias, and fake news - without the information literacy skills to separate good from bad. Technology has changed the way we access information, so we need to change the way we think about information. This means replacing ineffective heuristics with the digital, media, psychological, and scientific literacy skills required to be an informed 21st century citizen. </p>
        </li>

    <section class="about_philosophy u-grid-canvas">
      <h1 class="t-gray3 t-92dp">Our <br> <span class="t-teal2">Philosophy</span></h1>
      <p class="t-24dp">Every organization is built on a number of core values. We believe that these tenets serve as the foundation that supports everything we do. We’ve composed our philosophy through theory, self-reflection and by paying attention to the character of the organizations we respect most. They keep us accountable, they keep us evolving, and most importantly, they keep us inspired.</p>
      <ul>


        <li>
          <h2>Access </h2>
          <p>We believe that science shuld be truly accessible to everyone. True access includes financial, technical, and psychological access. Such solutions require examining the current patterns within culture, identities, and science itself, as well as the ways they interact.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Demand</h2>
          <p>When we say demand, we don’t mean people wanting it. We mean the things the world needs right now. We focus our efforts on the issues, gaps, and strategies that are the most timely and salient. We believe that focus is critical, and that changing the things that matter most can change everything else. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Beauty</h2>
          <p>Design is one part structure, one part aesthetic, and one part iteration. We believe that the combination of the three takes ideas and turns them into usable tools that can be shared, implemented, and refined over time. We believe beautiful work captures attention, communicate clearly, and inspires change.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h2>Evidence</h2>
        <p>We believe in starting at the edge of what is known and using evidence to inform strategy. We also believe in rigorously evaluating our efforts and reporting them to contribute to the landscape of what we know. As such, we believe in a feedback loop: we build based on what we know, we evaluate what we build, and we share what we learn with the community that shares our mission. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Collaboration</h2>
          <p>We are working against an intertial system, and if we want to steer the future of science and society, we’re going to have to work together. We believe in partnerships, dialogue between citizens and researchers, interdisciplinary approaches, and decentralized efforts. We can’t tackle this problem from a hundred different angles and expect results - we need to join forces and face it head on as a unified front that refuses to be ignored. </p>
        </li>
      <ul>
